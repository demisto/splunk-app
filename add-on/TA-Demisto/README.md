# ABOUT THIS APP

Supporting Add-on for Demisto, with BeyondCorp oauth support. This application allows a user to create incident or indicator in Demisto from Splunk using custom alert action.

# REQUIREMENTS

*  Splunk version 6.3 >=
*  This application should be installed on Search Head or Universal forwarder, Indexer, and Search Head if applicable.

# Recommended System configuration
*  Standard Splunk configuration of Search Head.

# Installation in Splunk Cloud
*  Same as on-premise setup.

# Installation of App

*  This app can be installed through UI using "Manage Apps" or from the command line using the following command:
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk install app $PATH_TO_SPL/TA-Demisto.spl/

# HTTPS Certificate Validation

The add-on uses secure communication with Demisto.

On few occasions it would be necessary to manually set a certificate for proper verification.

There are several options for adding a self-signed certificate or a certificate from internal certificate signers AFTER
installing the app:

1) Put the PEM formatted certificate bundle inside Splunk server under:
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-Demisto/local/cert_bundle.pem

2) Add the certificate to the app installation tgz:
    2.1) Extract TA-Demisto tgz
    2.2) Create "local" directory under TA-Demisto
    2.3) Place the certificate in that folder
    In the end the certificate should be in the following path:
    your-local-path/TA-Demisto/local/cert_bundle.pem

Splunk Cloud users should perform option 2 and send the app installer to Splunk support for installation.

Another option which applies ONLY for on-prem installations and cannot be used for Splunk Cloud:

Disabling the certificate validation entirely by POSTing to the Splunk REST API
https://splunk-server:8089/servicesNS/nobody/TA-Demisto/configs/conf-demistosetup/demistoenv
with the following as the request body:
verify_ssl=false

For example, via CURL:
curl -ku 'username:password' https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/TA-Demisto/configs/conf-demistosetup/demistoenv/ -d VALIDATE_SSL=false

To re-enable certificate validation post to the same endpoint but change "verify_ssl" to true.

For example, via CURL:
curl -ku 'username:password' https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/TA-Demisto/configs/conf-demistosetup/demistoenv/ -d VALIDATE_SSL=true

If you used version below 2.0.0 and disabled SSL you would need to execute the process above.

We recommend to use certificates, and only disabling certificate verification in development
or test environments only. Never disable certificate verification for a production system.

*  User can directly extract the app's SPL file into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder in order to install the app.

# Application Setup
*  The user must complete the setup of the application. In order to create incident into Demisto, a user needs to provide the following parameters:
    1) Demisto URL: This is mandatory parameter Url /IP address of the Demisto
    2) Demisto Port: This is an optional parameter. The user must define it if running Demisto on any other port than the default (443).
    3) Authentication key: This is a mandatory parameter. This parameter is used for authorization with Demisto. In order to generate this parameter,
      a user should log in to Demisto and then click on Settings --> Integration --> API Keys.
    4) Location to certificate: Enter the full path to the SSL Certificate in the Splunk server to if you are using Self Signed/Internal CA signed certificate
    5) HTTPS Proxy Address: This is an optional parameter. Define this if you have HTTPS proxy that should be used. Should be in the format of https://ip:port
    6) HTTPS Proxy Username: Username for the proxy
    7) HTTPS Proxy Password: Password for the proxy

# Custom Alert Action (Incident)
*  This application will add custom alert action named Create Demisto Incident Alert Action. The user can configure this action on saved search. The user can pass following parameters to Demisto:
    1) Name: Name of the alert.
    2) Occurred Time: Time when alert was triggered
    3) Type: Type in demisto.
    4) Labels: Comma separated values to be put in the label field.
    5) Severity: Severity of the alert
    6) Details: Details field in the incident.

# Custom Alert Action (Indicator)
*  This application will add custom alert action named Create Demisto Indicator Alert Action. The user can configure this action on saved search. The user can pass following parameters to Demisto:
    1) Indicator: Value of the indicator.
    2) Type: Dropdown to select type of indicator
    3) Reputation: Dropdown to select reputation
    4) Comment: Any notes related to indicator

# Multiple Servers Support
*  You can send incidents from one search head to multiple Demisto servers. In the app setup page:
  1) Write the servers in a comma separated manner. For example: hostname1,hostname2,hostname3
  2) If only some of the servers have specific ports, write '0' for the rest. For example: port1,0,port3
  3) Write the API keys in a comma separated manner. For example: APIkey1,APIkey2,APIkey3
  4) If only some of the servers have self-certified ssl certificates, write '0' for the rest. For example: cert1,0,cert3

# Demisto Server exclusions
*  You can choose to exclude specific servers from the "Send to all servers" function in a new incident or indicator.
  1) Write the servers in a comma separated manner. For example: hostname1,hostname2,hostname3
  2) Port is not required.

  Finish installation as usual.
  Afterwards, when you'll create a new alert, choose 'Create Demisto Incident' and you'll have an option 'Demisto Server' where you can choose the server to send the alert to.

  If you want to send alert to all of your Demisto servers, simply click the 'send alert to all of the servers' checkbox. No need to select a server in this scenario.

# BeyondCorp Support (https://research.google/pubs/pub43231/)
*  If you leverage BeyondCorp technology, Demisto has the ability to create incidents via BeyondCorp connections
  1) Enter API URL/Endpoint (note: multiple server support does not exist)
  2) Enter BeyondCorp Key
  3) Enter BeyondCorp Secret

# Troubleshooting
*  Splunk it via rest
    1) |rest "/servicesNS/nobody/TA-Demisto/storage/passwords"
    2) |rest "/servicesNS/nobody/TA-Demisto/configs/conf-demistosetup/demistoenv/"
*  Environment variable SPLUNK_HOME must be set
*  Check the following logs to troubleshoot Demisto's application:
    1) $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/demisto/demisto.log
    2) $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
    3) $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/demisto_modalert.log
*  If you change the app's settings several times in a row you might need to restart Splunk for them to update
